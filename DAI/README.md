_Please note that this document temporarily refers to sai instead of dai and skr instead of peth. These are just different variable names and their functionality is identical to what is described in the latest Dai documentation._


`sai` is a simple single-collateral stablecoin that is dependent on a
trusted oracle address and has a kill-switch.

See the [developer documentation](DEVELOPING.md) for a more technical
overview.

There are four tokens in the system:

- `gem`: externally valuable token e.g. ETH
- `gov`: governance token e.g. MKR
- `skr`: a claim to locked `gem`s
- `sai`: the stablecoin, a variable claim on some quantity of `gem`s

Collateral holders deposit their collateral using `join` and receive
`skr` tokens proportional to their deposit. `skr` can be redeemed for
collateral with `exit`. You will get more or less `gem` tokens for each
`skr` depending whether the system made a profit or loss while you
were exposed.

The oracle updates the GEM:REF and GOV:REF price feeds. These are the
only external real-time input to the system.

`skr` is used as the direct backing collateral for CDPs. A prospective
issuer can `open` an empty position, `lock` some `skr` and then `draw`
some `sai`. Debt is covered with `wipe`. Collateral can be reclaimed
with `free` as long as the CDP remains "safe".

If the value of the collateral backing the CDP falls below the
liquidation ratio `mat`, the CDP is vulnerable to liquidation via
`bite`. On liquidation, the CDP `skr` collateral is sold off to cover
the `sai` debt.

Under-collateralized CDPs can be liquidated with `bite`. Liquidation is
immediate: backing `skr` is taken to cover the `sai` debt at the time of
`bite`, plus a liquidation fee (`axe`); any excess remains in the CDP.

`skr` seized from bad CDPs can be purchased with `bust`, in exchange for
`sai` at the `s2s` price. This `sai` pays down the bad CDP debt.

Any remaining Sai surplus (`joy`) can be purchased with `boom`, in
exchange for `skr` at the `s2s` price. This `skr` is burned.


### Fees

Stability fee is continuously charged on all open cups according to `tax`.
It makes their debt (`tab`) increase over time.

Governance fee is continuously charged on all open cups according to `fee`.
It makes their debt (`rap`) increase over time.

### Settlement

`sai` can be shut down at a given price with `cage`, after which `sai`
and `skr` can be exchanged for `gems` via `cash`. All outstanding `cups`
are liquidated and the *entire pool* of `gem` is tapped to redeem `sai`
at their face value, as if the boom/bust trades were instantly settled
at the cage price.  Any remaining `gems` are shared between `skr`
holders.

Practically this means that if the system is undercollateralized on
`cage`, holders of free `skr` will have their `gem` share diluted as
much as necessary to make `sai` whole. *In other words, `skr` is a
risk bearing token*.

Excess collateral contained within a single `cup` can be reclaimed with
`bite(cup)`.
